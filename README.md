## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Backup Recommendation**: The extension will replace your existing `lib` folder. Consider backing up any custom code before running the setup.
- **Network Dependency**: Initial setup requires internet access to clone the template repository.
- **Clean Architecture**: The generated code follows Clean Architecture principles. Familiarity with this pattern is recommended.
- **Package Versions**: The extension installs the latest versions of packages. Review and lock versions as needed for production projects.

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

- **Internet Dependency**: Template download requires active internet connection
- **Existing Code**: May overwrite existing lib folder content without warning
- **Large Projects**: Setup time varies based on project size and internet speed
- **Git Requirements**: Requires Git to be installed and accessible from command line

## üìã Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**Extension not visible:** Restart VS Code after installation

**Setup fails:** Ensure Git is installed and internet connection is stable

**Package conflicts:** Use the "Fix Package Dependencies Issues" command

**Permission errors:** Ensure VS Code has write permissions to project folder

### **Debug Steps:**
1. Check VS Code's Developer Console (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`)
2. Verify Flutter and Git installations
3. Confirm project workspace is properly opened
4. Try running commands individually rather than complete setup
